CHARACTER TARGETING SYSTEM NEEDS:

1. NAMED CHARACTER LOOKUP:
   - Check if player has character with specific name
   - Most common: Gaston, Elsa, Anna, Jafar, Belle
   
2. CHARACTER TYPE LOOKUP:
   - Check if player has character with specific type/subtype
   - Most common: Princess, Villain, Captain, Puppy, Musketeer
   
3. CHARACTER COUNT CONDITIONS:
   - Check if player has X or more characters of type
   - Common patterns: "2 or more", "3 or more"
   
4. GENERIC CONDITIONS:
   - "another character" (any other character)
   - "other characters" (any others)

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Player.has_character_named(name: str) -> bool
- Player.has_character_type(type: str) -> bool  
- Player.count_characters_type(type: str) -> int
- Player.has_other_characters() -> bool
